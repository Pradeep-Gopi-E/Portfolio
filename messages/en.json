I leverage my full-stack background primarily to operationalize ML systems, building the necessary tools and interfaces to make models usable and testable.",
        "p2": "My expertise lies in developing end-to-end experimental pipelines and internal prototypes. Rather than managing large-scale legacy platforms, I thrive in the iterative process of taking a concept from a research paper and engineering a deployable, reproducible proof-of-concept.",
        "p3": "Beyond engineering, I am deeply committed to the open-source community and continuous learning. I actively contribute to research in computer vision and stay engaged with the latest developments in generative AI.",
